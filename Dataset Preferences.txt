Hi Dr.Wiggins,

Here are the top 4 preferences for our dataset choice:
1. Public Safety Calls Baltimore
2. World Food Facts
3. Traffic Violations Montgomery County
4. NOAA Severe Weather Data

Public Safety Calls Baltimore
The dataset 'Public Safety Calls Baltimore' is our first choice because it contains scores of data about a very intriguing and unseen sector of our society.
We are interested to find out how the type and number of 911 calls vary based on the proximity to the coast (for example, are there more emergency calls inland?)
Are there more emergency calls during the weekend? This data set would be perfect because it is updated on a daily basis and it is local.

World Food Facts
We are interested to work with the 'World Food Facts' dataset because it is an open database that does not contain trace data. 
The data set contains vast repository of food facts from almost every country in the world. 
We would like to find out whether a pattern exists between the obesity rate in a region and the amount of sugar and fat consumed in the same region (We will have to find anther data set related to obesity)
We are also curious about what type of food Europeans eat and how the food habits differ for each European country.
